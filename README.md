# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school board noticed evidence of academic dishonesty concerning reading and math scores at Thomas High School.  The alteration were specific to the 9th grade class in the file "students_complete.csv".  In order to keep to state-testing standards, the reading and math scores were ordered to be replaced with "NaN" but to keep the rest of the data intact. After replacing the requested data, the analysis on the school district data was repeated.
